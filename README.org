* QREncode EL

  QR-Code encoder written in pure Emacs Lisp.

  The code might still be buggy, but it can generate some QR
  codes. For example the self-link below:

  [[file:qr-self.png]]

  This package provides two user facing interactive functions, that
  will encode text into a QRCode and show it in a separate buffer.

  * =qrencode-region= :: Shows the current selection as a QRCode.
  * =qrencode-url-at-point= :: Encode URL at point as QRCode.

  Some customizations are provided using =M-x customize-group RET qrencode RET=.
